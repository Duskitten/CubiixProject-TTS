## "Cubiix Project: To The Stars!" is an open source Social MMO with RPG Elements

The project is maintained by Duskitten / [Selkspace](https://selkspace.xyz), and is licensed under the [Cubiix Project License](https://cubiixproject.xyz/en/License)

## Instructions

- The project is currently built with the [Revel Engine](https://github.com/Duskitten/revel) which is a fork Godot.
- You'll need to compile it if you'd like to use this project.
- Revel contains changes to maintain plugin compatibility so I am unsure if it will work on regular Godot Engine.
